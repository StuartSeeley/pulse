# Graphics overview

The screen is rendered with a charset of 128 8x8 pixel chars.  The charset
is split into two frames for double buffering.  Each frame takes up to 48
chars for sprites and 16 for the scrolling foreground or the score display.
The foreground is NOT double-buffered.

Sprite chars are dynamically allocated and shared by overlapping sprites.
When all sprites have been drawn, characters of the other frame are
removed from the screen.  The former positions of all sprites are saved to
do that.

The vertical edges of the foreground are drawn every 8 pixels and then
rotated in the charset for the remaining 7 pixels.  The edges leave trails
of rotating chars to fill large areas of the foreground.

The game doesn't wait for the retrace.  To keep the speed stable, sprites
aren't removed but replaced with a background star.


# Character map

128 chars are used as follows:

            0123456789ABCDEF
            ----------------
Frame A: 0| BSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
(0-63)   1| SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
         2| SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
         3| PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

Frame B: 4| SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
(64-127) 5| SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
         6| SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
         7| TTEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

         B = Plain nothing
         S = Sprites
         P = Score display
         T = Trailing foreground char
         E = Foreground edge


## Sprites

Up to 16 sprites can be drawn in the same frame.  Sprites are character
sized and may use up to four entries in the charset because they can be
positioned pixel-wise.  32 different sprite graphics can be used (the page
size limit).  Sprites may cross the border.


## Foreground

The foreground edges are three-character tiles of which up to 16 can be
used at the same time with up 32 different chars.  The rightmost char of
a tile is the trailing char.  All chars of a tile share the same color.
