[the sound of tuning over several radio stations, including Radio Eriwan and funny noises]
[Space Radio Denial fades in]

Somebody totally drunk:
    "What? Computer? (sound of drinking out a bottle fast) I can't remember that.
     No! Wait! Hang on! What wuzze question? Giz that bottle there, will ya?"
Moderator A:
    "Unfortunately, he died on Christmas 2015 when his liver finally imploded."

Moderator B:
    "And next week on Homebrew Heroes: beamrider. You might think you now
     everything about him but we might have a surprise or two on Sunday at 2000 GMT on "
[Denial jingle]
    "Now for the solar weather with Sharon Pyott, followed by the top hits echoing
     through the universe."

[Gianna Sisters wind sound at the beginning of the first level]
Moderator C:
[Radio on tone]
    "Welcome to space weather on Denial.
     Everyone near Mars should park behind the planet within 20 minutes as
     solar radiation is about to barecue the area for at least three hours.
     Good news for everybody on Pluto: nothing will change much. You'll probably
    freeze your nuts off for another four billion years."

    "Well, thanks Sharon. [Music] Don't worry, there's still nobody on Pluto.
     [Music] This is Pete Harris [Music] with the Beats Of Time providing you
     with the latest hits in the system. [Music starting to fade out]
     But till we continue with the regular program it's time for a couple of
     seconds of funny noise which is in fact a software update for your
     PWM radio receivers. Don't worry, we'll still sound shite
     across the universe even with double the sampling rate. Yes! We're baffled as well:
    PWM space radio Denial at 4kHz sampling rate and we're gonna celebrate that with no
    less than THE freshest number one hit from Venus to Pluto, Boray's "No Syrup". Uncut
    and uninterrupted. Back in a sec.
