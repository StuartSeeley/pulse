          The war with The Enemy was thought to be over. They destroyed all
          moderm computers with long–distance EMPs.  But little did they know
          about the creativity and inventiveness of the humans who just
          started over with the millions of rock–solid computers they
          mass–produced for entertainment in the 20th century.

          &#8220;Great!&#8221;, you think in your tiny, idle space ship at
          the outskirts of the Solar system as you slap Super Starship Space
          Attack into the tape drive of your board computer,
          &#8220;Home soon!&#8221;.

          Suddenly, the Final Expansion 42's emergency message receiver chills
          you down to the bone with a disgustingly loud honk.
          &#8220;Our enemy now attacks us from the 20th dimension!  We hastily
          created a remote drone control software!  You are one of the last
          pilots with the right hardware to use it out there.  We'll send it
          via radio in ten minutes. We don't know what to expect. We count on
          you! Hit fire! Always! &#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          You feel an episode of major psychotic hatred crawling up your spine.
          &#8220;Sordid buggers!&#8221;, you exclaim. &#8220;Always the bloody
          same! <i>THAT</i> you could send right on my computer but not that
          friggin' software!?&#8221;

          As you bang your head on the edges of broken tape recorders that you –
          despite the absence of gravity – threw away in your rage, it starts to make sense.
          Of course they'll send the software via PWM space radio Denial:
          to reach all pilots at once!
