          The war with The Enemy was thought to be over be&shy;fore it de&shy;stroyed all
          modern com&shy;puters on Earth with long–distance EMPs.  But little did they know
          about the crea&shy;tivi&shy;ty and in&shy;ventiveness of the humans who just
          star&shy;ted over with the mil&shy;lions of rock–solid com&shy;puters they
          mass–produced for enter&shy;tain&shy;ment in the late 20th cen&shy;tury.

          &#8220;Great!&#8221;, you think in your tiny space ship idling at
          the out&shy;skirts of the Solar sys&shy;tem as you slap <em>Super Starship Space
          Attack</em> into the tape drive of your board com&shy;puter,
          &#8220;Home soon!&#8221;. as sud&shy;denly the Final Expan&shy;sion 42th emer&shy;gency mes&shy;sage re&shy;ceiver chills

          &#8220;Our ene&shy;my now at&shy;tacks us from the 20<sup>th</sup> di&shy;men&shy;sion!  We has&shy;ti&shy;ly
          crea&shy;ted a re&shy;mote drone con&shy;trol soft&shy;ware!  You are one of the last
          pi&shy;lots with the right hard&shy;ware to use it out there.  We'll send it
          via ra&shy;dio in ten mi&shy;nu&shy;tes. We don't know what to ex&shy;pect. We count on

          de&shy;spite the ab&shy;sence of gra&shy;vit&shy;y – threw away in a rather mind&shy;less fashion,

          <em>Pulse</em> re&shy;quir&shy;es a joy&shy;stick. The game runs more slo&shy;wly
          with&shy;out mem&shy;ory ex&shy;pan&shy;sion. To enjoy the full ver&shy;sion a 16K memory
          ex&shy;pan&shy;sion and a real machine con&shy;nected to a cathode ray tube
          TV set would be preferable.
