        <h1>Some time ago in the future</h1>
        <p>
          The war with The Enemy was thought to be over. They destroyed all moderm
          computers with long–distance EMPs.
          But little did they know about the creativity and inventiveness
          of the humans who just started over with the millions of rock–solid computers
          they mass–produced for entertainment in the 20th century.
        </p>

          &#8220;Great!&#8221;, you think in your tiny, idle space ship at the outskirts
          of the Solar system as you slap Super Starship Space Attack into the tape
          drive of your board computer, &#8220;Home soon!&#8221;.
          Suddenly, the Final Extension 42's emergency message receiver chills
        </p>

      <div class="page2 page content">

you down to the bone with a disgustingly loud honk.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;Our enemy now attacks us from the 20th dimension!
          We hastily created a remote drone control software!
          You are one of the last pilots with the right hardware to use it out there.
          We'll send it via radio in ten minutes.
          We don't know what to expect. We count on you! Hit fire! Always!
          Class A pilots should remove all memory expansions to disable
          security delays and logging. A drone can approximately take three hits
          before you have to switch to the next.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          You feel an episode of major psychotic hatred crawling up your spine.
          &#8220;Sordid buggers!&#8221;, you
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page3 page content">
        <p>
exclaim. &#8220;Always the bloody same!
          <i>THAT</i> you could send right on my computer but not that friggin'
          software!?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          As you bang your head on the edges of broken tape recorders that you throw away in
          your rage, and which then race through the absence of gravity and bounce back from
          the walls, it starts to make
          sense. Of course they'll send the software via PWM space radio Denial:
          to reach all pilots at once!

        <h1>Game start</h1>
        <p>
          Type "LOAD", hit the RETURN key and follow the instructions on the screen.
          When the initial fast loader is loaded, keep PLAY pressed, type "RUN" and
          hit the RETURN key again. The game should now load to completion with
          a flurry of colours.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the game loads properly, a splash screen with music shows
          up. You can then stop the tape and rewind it to listen to particular
          parts of the music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only if the music is playing you can enter the game by pressing
          your joysitck's fire button.
