          The war with The Enemy was thought to be over be&shy;fore it de&shy;stroyed all
          modern com&shy;puters on Earth with long–distance EMPs.  But little did it know
          about the crea&shy;tivi&shy;ty and in&shy;ventiveness of the humans who just
          star&shy;ted over with the mil&shy;lions of rock–solid com&shy;puters they
          mass–produced for enter&shy;tain&shy;ment in the late 20th cen&shy;tury.

          &#8220;Our ene&shy;my now at&shy;tacks us from the 20<sup>th</sup> di&shy;men&shy;sion!  We has&shy;ti&shy;ly

          pi&shy;lots with the right hard&shy;ware to use it out there.  We'll send it
          via ra&shy;dio in ten mi&shy;nu&shy;tes. We don't know what to ex&shy;pect. We count on

          As you bang your head against the edges of bro&shy;ken tape re&shy;cor&shy;ders that you –
          de&shy;spite the ab&shy;sence of gra&shy;vit&shy;y – threw away in a rather mind&shy;less fashion,
